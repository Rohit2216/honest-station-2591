<h1 align="center">TIC TAC TOE</h1>
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game in which the objective is to take turns and mark the correct spaces in a 3x3 (or larger) grid. Think on your feet but also be careful, as the first player who places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game!
