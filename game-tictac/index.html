                <h4><span>Tic Tac Toe </span>is traditionally played on a 3 × 3 grid. Players take turns placing a mark in one of the cells of the grid. The goal of the game is for players to position their marks so that they make a continuous line of three cells vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. An opponent can prevent a win by blocking the completion of the opponent’s line. In our variant of the game, players placed objects on a board. In order to induce participants to produce utterances that were usable for analysis, participants had their own playing boards and faced away from each other, so that verbal communication was required. Each player had a group of red objects and a group of blue objects, and was randomly assigned a color. Each of the cells in the grid was labeled with a number from 1 to 9, so that the players could indicate cell position by number. The number was the critical target word used in the analysis.</h4>
